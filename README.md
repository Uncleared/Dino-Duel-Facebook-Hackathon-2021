# Dino-Duel-Facebook-Hackathon-2021
The project was created with Unity 2020.3.23 so make sure to open it up with that

The game makes use of hand tracking and passthrough, so make sure to enable Hand Tracking on your Meta Quest 2 device, and also turn Experimental Features on.

You can sideload the game onto your Meta Quest 2 using Side Quest or an adb command. The apk can be found in the "apkbuilds" folder, named "DinoDuel.apk".

Warning: In the first section when you say "I choose you", sometimes it is quite unresponsive for some reason, despite working fine on Desktop, but it definitely works, you just need to give it a few tries.

In-game tutorial is by no means comprehensive, please watch the demo video for reference if you are confused: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCK9LdcFhoI&ab_channel=PlectrumXR
The game will automatically restart after you win/lose.
