# Dino-Duel-Facebook-Hackathon-2021
## How to load the game(APK)
You can sideload the game onto your Meta Quest 2 using Side Quest or an adb command. The apk can be found in the "apkbuilds" folder, named "DinoDuel.apk". If you're just here for the game, you don't have to download the whole repo, just navigate to apk and download that directly! 
## Project
The project was created with Unity 2020.3.23 so make sure to open it up with that. To access the main game scene, open the "DinoDuel" scene. There may be many extra scenes included because the project has iterated many times.

## Things to be mindful of
The game makes use of hand tracking and passthrough, so make sure to enable Hand Tracking on your Meta Quest 2 device, and also turn Experimental Features on.
## Commands
The plan was to include every single compliment and discouragement I could think of, so that there is no need for a tutorial. However, I ran out of time. If you're struggling to adjust the Dino's morale, say things like "you're amazing", "doing good", "you suck", "you're an idiot sandwich".
## Warning:
Warning: In the first section when you say "I choose you", sometimes it is quite unresponsive for some reason, despite working fine on Desktop, but it definitely works, you just need to give it a few tries.
## Final Notes
In-game tutorial is by no means comprehensive, please watch the demo video for reference if you are confused: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCK9LdcFhoI&ab_channel=PlectrumXR
The game will automatically restart after you win/lose.
