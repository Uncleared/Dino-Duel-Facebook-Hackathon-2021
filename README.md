The project was created with Unity 2020.3.23 so make sure to open it up with that

The game makes use of hand tracking and passthrough, so make sure to enable Hand Tracking on your Oculus Quest device, and also turn Experimental Features on.

You can sideload the game onto your Oculus Quest using Side Quest or a adb command. The apk can be found in the "apkbuilds" folder.

Warning: In the first section when you say "I choose you", sometimes it is quite unresponsive for some reason, despite working fine on Desktop, but it definitely works, you just need to give it a few tries.

Ingame tutorial by no means comprehensive, please watch the demo video for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCK9LdcFhoI&ab_channel=PlectrumXR
